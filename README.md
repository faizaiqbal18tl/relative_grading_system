# relative_grading_system
I have done comparative analysis between different grading schemes (i.e., absolute vs. relative grading scheme) on my university data.
Relative grading scheme can be implemented using Normal Distribution Curve. I have calculated the Mean and Standard Deviation of student's marks and calculated their Grades based on 
student's performance instead of pre defined letters assigned to marks like if a student is scoring 85% he will get an A+. Relative grading assign grades to students on their overall 
performance (i.e., Top 10% will achieve A, Next 20% will achieve B and so on) , and the results will appear on a bell shaped curve being symmetric on both sides.
